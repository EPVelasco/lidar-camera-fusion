# Description
The code implemented in ROS projects a point cloud obtained by a Velodyne VLP16 3D-Lidar sensor on an image from an RGB camera. The example used the ROS package to calibrate a camera and a LiDAR from [lidar_camera_calibration](https://github.com/ankitdhall/lidar_camera_calibration). In order to have points in a denser cloud, we interpolate the point cloud data by converting the point cloud to a range image and a bilinear interpolation with the armadillo library.

## Interpolated point cloud 
The white dots are the original point cloud of the Velodyne VLP-16 lidar. The colored dots are the interpolated point cloud.

## Ros Launch

You can use this [rosbag](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EbWivNqDltEiDCsxMq3DlNJqxVt9cetT/view?usp=sharing) to test the repository.  Please note that the homogeneous camera-LiDAR matrix has inaccuracies. We are recalibrating the camera and LiDAR to reduce this error. However, you can get an idea of how the package works and how it merges the Realsense D435 camera and the Velodyne VLP16 LiDAR. 

#### Rosbag play 

```
  rosbag play ~/{your_rosbag path}/cam_lidar00.bag
```
#### Lidar and camera fusion with rosbag
```
  roslaunch lidar_camera_fusion vlp16OnImg_offline.launch 
```
#### Lidar and camera fusion with real sensors
```
  roslaunch lidar_camera_fusion vlp16OnImg.launch 
```
#### Interpolated point cloud
```
  roslaunch lidar_camera_fusion interpolated_vlp16.launch
```


## Testing the package
### LiDAR Odometry
Lidar odometry has been experimented with the original point cloud and with the interpolated point cloud. You need to install the [FLOAM](https://github.com/wh200720041/floam) package, it is recommended to use the following [fork](https://github.com/EPVelasco/floam).
We prepared a [rosbag](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WYWej0UB6PyBj9w5u74Qz_HHuECYS-DC/view?usp=share_link) for testing with the LiDAR odometry and LiDAR interpolation package. The rosbag is from a closed loop in an outdoor environment generated with a velodyne VLP16. 
It is necessary to modify the name of the topic in the [launch](https://github.com/EPVelasco/floam/blob/master/launch/floam_experimets.launch#LL29C4-L29C65) file. Thus, to run FLOAM with the original point cloud you put the topic */velodyne_points*, and to launch FLOAM with the interpolated lidar you have to put the topic 

#### Launch FLOAM, interpolated_vlp16 and rosbag
```
roslaunch floam floam_experimets.launch
roslaunch lidar_camera_fusion interpolated_vlp16.launch
rosbag play {your/rosbag/file/address}/loop_8.bag
```
### Results
The image shows the odometry results with the FLOAM package, where the path A and B are generated by the point cloud without interpolation and interpolated respectively. The test was performed after running the rosbag 4 times in a row.
